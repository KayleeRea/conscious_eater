The pork ribs were brought to the table first only they weren&#39;t pork. They were lamb. We asked the server about it and she said &quot;oh yeah...it&#39;s not pork, it&#39;s lamb.&quot; Though she did comp us that dish, her attitude stunk and she was not exactly apologetic. The ribs themselves were tasty but were overpowered by a garlic. Next, out came the chicken skewers which were undercooked and contained a very tasteless coconut milk dipping sauce and side of &quot;slaw&quot; that was bland. Our main courses were served - and in fairness were better than the starters - however, one of our party ordered a salad, which arrived a good 10 minutes after all the other plates had been served. Again, the waitress seemed unconcerned; never offered a real apology. For all these reasons, we won&#39;t be going back again.",
